CokeCuke
========

This project contains support for acceptance testing Cocos2D iPhone games with
iCuke.

Overview
--------

iCuke uses the UIKit accessibility features to scrape the contents of the
screen so that Cucumber steps may be written that interacts with a program
running in the iPhone simulator.  Unfortunately, Cocos2D is not based on
UIKit, and so Cocos2D objects (CCNodes) aren't available to iCuke.

The categories provided here allow iCuke to be used unmodified by providing
some help to it at run time.  To do this, we mimic a little bit of UIKit-like
functionality and point the way to our scene graph.  There shouldn't be any
problem shipping these categories in production - they won't be used unless
the app is run under the simulator with iCuke's preloaded library, and it
is not a lot of code.

Installation
------------

Copy the headers and Objective-C files from this directory into your project.

Node Labels
-----------

CCNodes do not have anything equivalent to a label by default, so you should
call [node setAccessibilityLabel:@"zombie"].  This allows you to say 'Given I
tap "zombie"' in the cucumber feature.

You can alternately override -accessibilityLabel when subclassing CCNode.

Node Values
-----------

iCuke uses the value returned by -accessibilityValue as a control's value.  You
can set this value with -setAccessibilityValue:.

Nodes implementing CCTextLabelProtocol will have their accessibilityValue track
the textual contents of the label unless the value is overridden with
-setAccessibilityValue:.
